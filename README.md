# symmetrical-umbrella
This repository is a starting point for stuff that I need. It is one big repository because I currently see no reason to have multiple repositories.

## Folders

- application/
    - what a person would interact with
    - also application subsystems	
		
- component/
    - convenience macros
    - utility libraries
    - math
    - data structures

- foreign/
    - foreign library bindings
    - binaries
    - unmodified forks
    - convenience wrappers around standardized things, like ascii, ieee-754 floats, qwerty keyboards, opengl, common lisp
    - convenience wrappers around other libraries

- unused/
    - random code which is not necessarily maintained or functional
	
## Platforms
Tested on:
- Ubuntu 16.04 sbcl x86_64

## Requirements
- glfw3
- ffmpeg
- openal
