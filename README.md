# symmetrical-umbrella
symmetrical-umbrella contains whatever I need it to because there is currently no reason to have multiple repositories

## Folders

    - also application subsystems

    - convenience wrappers around standardized things, like ascii, ieee-754 floats, qwerty keyboards, opengl, common lisp
    - convenience wrappers around other libraries

- unused/
    - random code which is not necessarily maintained or functional
