sucle is not a minecraft clone.
sucle is not an unreal engine clone.
sucle does not seek to rival emacs.

sucle is not for data visualization, such as d3.js
sucle is not for looking at memes.

sucle is:
- simple
- jump around in an infinite block world inspired by:
-- himno
-- super mario maker

it should be simple voxels, but like walking around in a dream.

TODO:
consolidate
- lem-opengl impl + ncurses-clone into sucle
- mesh to either display lists or vaos -> a number is a display list, an object is a vao[DONE]

TODO:
remove all '::'? so all packages export correctly?

TODO:
put all of glhelp in one file?[DONE]

TODO:
- logger
- documentation generation
- web presence, http, server
- update testbed, change-world, text-subsystem to use glhelp:create-vao-or-display-list-from-specs,
compress even further with scratch-buffer:flush-my-iterator and scratch-buffer:bind-in* [DON E]

TODO:
- replace nsb-cga and cameera-matrix with 3d-vectors and 3d-matrics.
  - mfiano/origin is not portable
  - rtg-math has too many packages, and missing some functions
  - 3d-vectors and 3d-matrics have consing and non-consing versions
- merge window and window-opengl-glfw
- write a test case for every single system, along with an explanation
- refactor physics engine

TODO:
- runtime dependencies of glfw-bodge blob

TODO:
- separate out opengl state changes and batch events. The chunk manager needs to have knowledge
of opengl in order to clean up old meshes.

TODO:
- sucle.lisp, change-world.lisp, and world.lisp all contain code for saving and loading the world. 

TODO:
- refactor physics engine into managable state, have multiple aabbs and intersections. spatial hashmap lke the voxel one? loose grid?
- bring ncurses-clone over from lem-opengl and use it here
- exhaustively write tests and documentation
- replace nsb-cga and camera-matrix with 3d-vectors
- refactor input, use event system? ECS? keymap?

other:
- frustum culling aabbs?
- query object culling for everything?
