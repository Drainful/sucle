Explanation of files and directories

-sandbox [directory] is where the undecidability lies. it is where the threads live,
like the meshing thread, the rendering thread, and the physics thread.
sandbox currently contains:
-magic for loading assets and general conversion between things, like loading
images into textures and keeping it in global memory
-sandbox is the entry point "main" and has timed threads for the rendering 
loop and physics loop. loop uses a tail call so it 
can be updated during runtime
-global contains things for keeping track of global state/keeping things in one
place: opengl is a global state machine, keep track of textures, call lists
programs. loaded images and text and other things are currently convenient to 
keep track of all in one place
-player-controls is a file which needs to be split into subfiles, for code 
such as keeping track of changes to the world, setting blocks in the world
[like light, metadata, skylight, and value] at the same time, aabb collisions,
player movement and input, block patterns
-blocks contains arrays in package "mc-blocks" which correspond to different 
block types, like specifying textures and bounding boxes [unused]
-block-meshing reads from world and creates a mesh of voxels according 
to blocks. compiled code is extra long due to inlining because of floats
to avoid consing
-lovely-renderer contains the main code rendered per each loop
-meshing-thread - designating a thread to mesh blocks and collecting the 
result afterwards
-draw-environment - draw clouds, sky, stars, sun, moon, etc...

-TODO is a list of things to do
-TODONE is a where the todo's go when they are finished

- world provides the facilities for reading and writing to voxel worlds. It is random access and provides light, skylight, blocks, metadata per voxel
for example.

- vox provides the mechanisms to generate code as in the 
voxel world reader/writer above

-window provides a skin between the various windowers and gl contexts. 
such as sdl or glfw

-the-matrix-is-everywhere is a half-baked matrix library

-recycler is a basic mechanism for recycling objects. Say an array is consed
and the program wants another array. instead of garbage collecting one array
and consing another, the array is given to the recycler

-queue provides some very simple queues

-pix is the half baked version of vox/world

-bitwise provides mechanisms for inspecting raw low level bits.
-pathwise is about files and directories
-listwise is about conses, lists, and trees
-imagewise is about manipulating images, which are generally arrays

-macrology has some general macros and code generation facilities

-aabbcc contains facilities for intersection between moving cuboids

-cl-mc-shit is a half-baked cffi binding to the cNBT c library

opengl specific:
-glshader contains code to make a shader, use a shader, and set uniforms
